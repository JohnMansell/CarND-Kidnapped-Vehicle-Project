# Objective
> Your robot has been kidnapped and transported to a new location! Luckily it has a map of this location, a (noisy) 
GPS estimate of its initial location, and lots of (noisy) sensor and control data. In this project you will implement
 a 2 dimensional particle filter in C++. Your particle filter will be given a map and some initial localization 
 information (analogous to what a GPS would provide). At each time step your filter will also get observation and 
 control data.
